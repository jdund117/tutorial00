# Tutorial #00: Jeff Dundore

This repository is the first of several emoji-ridden tutorials in a series of emoji-ridden Python instructional content that Aakash is driven enough to make for a near-dropout music major to work through.

This repository shows that I, Fug Chugson esq., have successfully managed to accomplish nothing of mention, but also the following basic tasks on Windows:
- Set up Git and GitHub synchronously.
- Edit and create basic Python scripting code.
- Perform scripting in Command Prompt, Jupyther, and an IDE of my choice, which just so happens to be this one.
