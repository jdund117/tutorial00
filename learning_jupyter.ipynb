    "Hello and welcome to your first **Jupyter Notebook tutorial**! üëã\n",
    "\n",
    "From this point on, most (if not all) of your direct coding tutorials and challenges will be contained in nicely sized and accessible *Jupyter Notebooks*, like the one you're viewing right at this moment. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is because Jupyter has several advantages for learning and rapid code development over a traditional IDE (like *VS Code*), including but not limited to the following:\n",

    "- Contains Jupyter cells for *rapid code creation* and testing. üí®\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Undoubtedly, one of Jupyter's greatest strengths is being able to **read, write, and test code very, very quickly**. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is done because Jupyter is running off of a virtual instance of Python, which is basically like a type of \"projection\". It's using Python, but with some hacks and tricks in order to accelerate Python's ability to run and construct code under-the-hood. \n",
    "\n",
    "### This is done through the use of *Jupyter Cells*.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A **Jupyter cell** is a dynamic cell-like object in a Jupyter Notebook that can accept and run editable text and data and send it back-and-forth between the user and the host server. This contracts starkly from an IDE, which doesn't use a server instance and instead runs entire Python scripts all-at-once by running the instructions directly to your computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "If that's confusing, don't worry ‚Äì¬†it should be. That's why software developent and coding often necessitates the use of analogies and examples to understand how all this stuff works! \n",
    "\n",
    "A better way to think of it is using the example of a **diner**. In a diner, imagine you have a team of waiters getting food orders from customers and delivering it to the kitchen. Then, after the kitchen has processed the order and created the food that the customer wants, the waiter retrieves the food and delivers it to the appropriate customer. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is similar to how code runs on your computer, you write the *higher-level code* (initial food order), then the code interpreter in your notebook/IDE (waiter) takes the instructions and *converts it into lower-level machine code* to run using the electronic components within your computer (waiter takes the order to the restaurant). After your computer has *processed the instructions* and fulfilled your code's requests (kitchen makes the food), the interpreter (waiter) *retrieves the output of the machine code* and delivers it to you, the user, via the interpreter or another app, like the Command Prompt (waiter delivers your food). \n",
    "\n",
    "What's unique is that while a traditional IDE ‚Äì¬†like *VS Code* ‚Äì¬†is like one or two really, really **strong** waiter(s), able to carry an extremely large amount of orders and food but focusing on individual orders/deliveries at one time, Jupyter Notebooks are like teams of dozens of tiny, agile, and weaker waiters, able to carry out multiple orders and deliveries, but each order is relatively small. \n",
    "\n",
    "Like much in the world of software, the truth is undoubtedly more complex and hard-to-understand, but we don't really worry about that. For now, what matters is understanding these cells enough to get them to work! üîß"
